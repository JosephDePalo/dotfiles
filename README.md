Config files for my PC. My theming is entirely centered around the Pywal application. As such, a fair amount of setting up my dot files involves linking the contents of ~/.cache/wal to various locations.

Included also is a script under the `custom` folder that will perform most of the updates necessary to seamlessly transition wallpapers.
